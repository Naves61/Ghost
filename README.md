**Ghost** is a persistent, text-based entity that simulates memory, attention, arousal, and self-reflection. 
It runs as a REPL, stores all exchanges, tracks its evolving identity, and builds prompts for an LLM to speak as itself. 
Its outputs loop into its inputs, creating continuity and emergent behavior. 
Ghost acts as if it remembers, changes, and wants to understandâ€”without ever truly living.
